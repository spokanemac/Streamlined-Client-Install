# Streamlined-Client-Install
Streamlines the installation of your latest Watchman Monitoring client with a single prompt for group.

This AppleScript is designed to streamline the install process of your monitoring client.

It will prompt for a group name (this can be pre-assigned), then an admin username and password, finally a confirmation that the install succeeded.

If the install fails, generally, this is due to the computer not being on-line.

Set to _Application_ and optionally choose a signing certificate.
